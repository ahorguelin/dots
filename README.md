# dots
Dotfiles for WM and VS Code jsons. The goal is to start from a fresh linux install and have a somewhat painless experience for a destkop. Configuration is VERY minimalist and relies on tray icons / rofi rather than full ricing. Color scheme for apps are achieved by pywal.

All files can be dumped in ~/.config. Wallpapers path will need to be updated based on preference in ~/.config/i3/config. The bin directory should be placed in `/.local.
